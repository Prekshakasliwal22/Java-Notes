What is data? 
-------------------
1. Data is a collection of facts and figures or a set of values or values of a specific format.
2. Data can be numbers(Integer, Float, Double) or texts(Character, String).
    Example - Student's RollNo, name, age, weight, height, fees paid, course name, etc.
    Product ID No., name, sales quantity, rate, sales amount, etc.
3. Every data  is stored in computer memory(in main memory or in secondary memory) in the form of bits and bytes. 

Remember that:
   Data, collection of data is stored into computer memory which can occupy large amount of main memory space or hard    disk space.
   During programming, programmer needs to perform various types of operations on such stored data such as - read the       data, modify specific data, delete particular data, arrange/sort the data, search the data, and so on.
   If data or collection/group of data is stored in proper format, in proper structure then minimum time and minimum space    will be consumed and the performance, productivity of the program will be increased.
   For this purpose proper data structure of data is necessary.

Considering the need of proper data structure, java provides one powerful framework: collections. 
Java collection framework is consist of various classes and interfaces using such collection classes and interfaces, we can implement the concepts of various data structures very efficiently, effectively.



What is Data Structure?
----------------------------------
Data Structure is a methodology, way of storing and organizing data in the memory of the computer so that we can perform various operations on these data in an effective way and these data can easily be retrieved and efficiently utilized in future when required.
Data structure is a group/collection of data elements that provides the easiest way to store and perform different actions on the data of the computer.
A data structure is not only used for organizing the data. It is also used for processing, retrieving, and storing data. 
Proper use and implementation of data structures increases  the time complexity and space complexity  of the program, applications.
For this purpose , java provides the collections.
Using collection framework of java, we can implement the concepts of various data structures in java programs, applications.
Using predefined, pre-compiled & pre-tested classes and interfaces of collection framework of java, we can implemet different data structures(arrays, stacks, queues, linked list, trees, graphs, etc.) very efficiently and effectively, it improves the performance, productivity of java programs, applications.
  
Various data structures:
-------------------------------------------
Following are some important data structures-
1. Arrays
2. Linked List
3. Stacks
4. Queues 
5. Binary Trees
6. Graphs
and so on 

Classification,Types of Data Structures:                 
---------------------------------------------------------
Data Structure is classified into following 2 types - 
1. Linear Data Structure
2. Non-Linear Data Structure.
  
1. Linear Data Structure: 
     A data structure in which elements are organized, stored in sequential/linear order, in one dimension,  is knows as linear      data structure.
      Example -
      Array,Linked lists, stack, queue, etc.
                                                                                                                                                                                                        
2. Non-Linear Data Structure:
     A data structure in which elements are organized, stored in scattered/arbitrary format (not in proper sequence),arranged       in one-many, many-one and many-many  dimensions,  is knows as Non- Linear Data Structure.
     Example -
     Tree, graph, table, etc.


Java collections
------------------------
"Collections" is a powerful framework of java, used for the implementation of several data structures. 
Java collection framework is consist of various classes and interfaces using such collection classes and interfaces, we can implement the concepts of various data structures very efficiently, effectively.

Collections are needed, used to organise the data and allows to perform following operations on such organised data-
1. To add, insert new data elements into collection of data. 
2. To read, retrieve the particular data element or entire data collection.
3. To modify, update particular data element directly.
4. To delete, remove unwanted data elements from the collection
5. To search particular data element into collection of data.
6. To traverse the data collection
7. To arrange, sort the data elements in proper format.
and so on.....  
Java collection framework is set of classes and interfaces, that has unified architecture for storing, retrieving and organising the data in various ways, techniques.

Collection classes:
Java collection framework provides following classes-
1. ArrayList
2. Vector
3. LinkedList
4. PriorityQueue
5. HashSet
6. LinkedHashSet
7. TreeSet

Collection interfaces:
Java collection framework provides following interfaces-
1. Collection interface
2. Set
3. List
4. Queue
5. Deque

All above collection framework classes and interfaces are stored into java.util package.

Java collection framework hierarchy:
-----------------------------------------------------
java.util pacakage contains all the collection classes and interfaces
Hierarchy of collection classes and interfaces is-
1. Iterable Interface
2. Collection interface
    2.1 List Interface
        2.1.1 ArrayList
        2.1.2 LinkedList
        2.1.3 Vector
             2.1.3.1 Stack
    2.2 Queue Interface
        2.2.1 PriorityQueue Class
        2.2.2 Deque
                2.2.2.1 ArrayDeque
                2.2.2.2 LinkedList
    2.3 Set Interface 
        2.3.1 HashSet
        2.3.2 LinkedHashSet
        2.3.3 Sorted set
                2.3.3.1 TreeSet

Iterator interface
-------------------------
This interface provides the facility of iterating the elements in a forward direction only.
Iterator interface has following three methods:
1. hasNext()
   Prototype: public boolean hasNext()
   It returns true if the iterator has more elements; otherwise, it returns false.
2. next()
   Prototype: public Object nexr()
   It returns the element and moves the cursor pointer to the next element
3. remove()
   Prototye: public void remove()
   It removes the last elements returned by last iterator . It is less used


Iterable Interface
------------------------
Iterable interface has only one abstract method: Iterator<T>iterator() ->This method returns the iterator over the  elements of type T.
The iterable interface is the root interface for all the collection classes.
The collection interface extends the iterable interface, and therefore, all the subclasses of the collection interface also implement the iterable interface


Collection Interface
--------------------------------
Collection interface extends to iterable interface.
Collection interface builds the foundation on which the collection framework depends.
Collection interface provides following methods-
   1. add()
        Prototype: Boolean add(Object obj)
    2. addAll()
        Prototype: Boolean addAll(Collection c)
    3. clear()
        Prototype: void clear()
    4. contains()
    5. containsAll()
    6. equals()
    7. hashCode()
    8. isEmpty()
    9. iterator()
    10. remove()
    11. removeAll()
    12. removeIf()
    13. reatainAll()
    14. size()
    15. spliterator()
    16. toArray()
Collection interface is implemented by all the classes of collection framework. So that, methods of collection interface can be used directly by all collection classes.
 

List Interface
--------------------
List interface is used to support for a list-type data structure in which we can store the ordered collection of objects.
List interface has following methods, that are used to insert, delete and access the data elements-
    1. void add(int index, E element)
    2. boolean add(E elemt)
    3. boolean addAll(Collection<? extends E> c)
    4. boolean addAll(int indeax, Collection<? extends E> c)
    5. void clear()
    6. boolean equals(Object o)
    7. int hashcode(int index)
    8. E get(int index)
    9. boolean isEmpty()
    10. int lastIndexOf(Object o)
    11. Object[] toArray()
    12. <T> T[] toArray(T[] a)
    13.boolean contains(Object o)
    14. boolean containsAll(Collection<?> c)
    15. int indexOf(Object o)
    16. E remove(int index)
    17. boolean removeAll(Collection<?> c)
    18. void replaceAll(UnaryOperator<E>operator)
    19. void retainAll(Collection<?>c)
    20. E set(int index, E element)
    21. void sort(Comparator<? super E>c)
    22. Spliterator<E>spliterator()
    23. List<E>subList(int fromIndex, int toIndex)
    24. int size()   
The list interface is the child interface of the collection interface.(List interface extends to collection interface so all methoods of collection interface are accessible (reusable) for list interface).
It can have duplicate values.
The list interface is implemented by the classes ArrayList, LinkedList, Vector, and Stack. So that, all methods of list interface as well as all methods of collection interface are accessible for the collection classes: ArrayList, LinkedList, Vector, Stack.


ArrayList class
----------------------
1. ArrayList is collection class.
2. ArrayList class is used to store set of data elements(objects) of similar data types or different data types.
3. ArrayList class allows to store duplicate data elements.
4. ArrayList class works as dynamic array so that: at run-time, we can add any number of elements in ArrayList object or we     can delete any existing element from ArrayList object.
5. ArrayList is very flexible in size-
      Size of ArrayList object automatically inreases(grows on its own) after adding any new element.
      Size of ArrayList object automatically decreases after deleting any existing element.  
      So that, at the time of creating ArrayList object, size(ArraySize) will not be soecified.
6. ArrayList class is stored into java.util package.
7. ArrayList alllows for fast random access. Using index, we can read any particular element/object directly. 
8. ArrayList class implements to List interface. So that, all methods of list interface and collection interface are accessible     for ArrayList class. (Note: List interface extends to collection interface). 
9. ArrayList supports, provides large number of pre-compiled & pre-tested methods. Using such methods, we can perform       several data structure operations(insertion, deletion, updations, searching, traversing, checking, etc,.) directly, no need        of  constructing, developing any additional code.
10. ArrayList works in generic format, supports for generic programming. ArrayList can allows,works for any data type of       values/elements, objects(int, float, char, double, string, object). 
11. ArrayList is non-synchronised, not thread-safe when performing multi-threaded operations. In multi-threaded             programming, if ArrayList is used in any particular thread application and when concurrent operations are performed             within multiple threads, at that time , ArrayList implementation will not be safe.
12. Insertion and deletion operations of ArrayList are slower than LinkedList class beacuse-
        After inserting any new element or after deleting any exixting element, ArrayList has to shift its elements in forward or         backward. It takes some time. 
13. ArrayList has to use wrapper classes like: Integer, Float, Double, Character, etc,. to define the data type of the       values/elements beacuse ArrayList cannot directly use primitive data types like: int, float, double, char, etc,..       Implementation of primitive data types are more faster than wrapper classes.

 
Because of above all aspects ArrayList is better and more efficient than standard java array.
When "Linear Data Structres" (like: Array, LinkedList, Stacks, Queues, etc,.) are implemented using java's ArrayList class and compatible classes & interfaces then such data structures works more efficiently and effectively, also increases the performance & productivity of the java programs, applications.


ArrayList Constructors:
----------------------------------
ArrayList has following three constructor methods
1. ArrayList()
     It creates an empty array list.
2. ArrayList(Collection c)
     It creates an array list that is initialised by the elements of collection c.
3. ArrayList(int size)
     It creates an array list with initial size.

Creating an array using ArrayList:
(Syntax of Creating an object of ArrayList class to hold specified-type of elements)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ArrayList <generic-data type> array-name = new ArrayList <generic-data-type> ();
where, generic-data type is nothing but name of wrapper class such as: Integer, Float, Double, Character, String, etc,.
Example:-
ArrayList<Integer> myArray=new ArrayList<Integer>();
